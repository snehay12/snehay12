# 👋 Hi, I'm Sneha

Vice President at Citi with 15+ years of experience building and leading large-scale financial systems.  
I currently lead a team of 6 developers delivering highly reliable, scalable platforms in regulated environments.

My core focus has been **automating high-risk, manual touchpoint operations** and transforming them into
**resilient, highly available, event-driven systems**.

Alongside my leadership role, I’m actively expanding into **Python, data engineering, and AI engineering**
to build intelligent, automation-first financial systems.
